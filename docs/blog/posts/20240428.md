# 2024.4.28 Summary

Zero progress in Paper reading, which is not good.

<!-- more -->

I should and i will give up playing games tomorrow, and focus myself more in study.

I start my learning at kaggle platform, which will be beneficial for my data science study, i think, and i have finished several couses of MachineLearning for beginers.

I also complete my learning at FreeCodeCamp Chapter two, which is also about string manipulation, i learned some useful skills.

Tomorrow is a new day, since i have determined to be a better person, than i should be more devoted in my study!

I hope everything going well tomorrow.
