# 2024.5.3 Summary

I temporarily finished building my website. It is really fullfilling for me to look back and see how I gradually completed the construction of my website, espacially start from zero basis.

<!-- more -->

However, I'm still confuse whether it was a good choice to spend two days on building such website. I should get rid of that thought, and focus on how i can make full use of this web!

This days I spare myself from the burden of study, and really have fun with my friends in games. But with the final exam approaching, I should put more attention on learning. What's more, make sure at least read one paper a day.

Finally, I received a very good news this morning, which is our team had won the Meritorious winner at ICM contest, I believe my joy was more than anyone can imagine.

May I continue to give myself the joy of success in continuing to ascend like this, and wish me good luck tomorrow and everyday!
