# 2024.4.24 Summary

Today, I finished installing the Virtual machine with Ubuntu22.04 in my computer.

Tried to change mirror source
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list_backup
backup my sources list in sources.list_backup

when i use `wget + url` to fetch the pack of anaconda3 in a shell, i failed with an error
Proxy request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden 2024-04-24 21:27:34 ERROR 403: Forbidden.
i tried to replace the source list with Tsinghua Source mirror, but it didn't work out
finally i managed to install anaconda3 by using the following command:
`wget --user-agent="Mozilla" + url`
due to the server will reject an user proxy which is not begin with Mozilla or not including Wget.

my anaconda3 position:
/home/mingkun/anaconda3
